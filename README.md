Challenges faced:
 1) I had problems with getting the code to execute only to realise that the functions were not working because of a capital letter where a lower case letter should have been. For a long time I thought the code was all wrong as I checked all semi-colons and curly braces and spelling mistakes but not thinking and not checking a capital letter.

This gladly solved my problem and I entered the same code in different ways 3/4 times to try make it work.

2) Another challenge I faced was not being able to get the addition to work when to values were given in the prompt. This led me to create a few different versions of the calculator in order to see where my error was and why it was always giving me the result as a string where it would just combine the two values together. For example, 1 + 1 would give me 11 and not the value of 2 which I was looking for. This led me to do some research and found that I had to use "parseInt" which would convert my value to be read as an integer. This then resolved my issue when I placed ParseInt in my code and my result would finally be read as a 2.

This solved my problem and I was able to have a fully working calculator.

My fully working calculator is "Option 4" as it has all the updated features with the correct code.
